[DEPRECATED] roosevelt-closure
===

**DEPRECATED: This module is obsoleted by the release of Roosevelt >=0.16.x. You may still need it if you are using Roosevelt <=0.15.x, but it is recommended to upgrade your Roosevelt apps to >=0.16.x as soon as you can because older versions (including this submodule!) are no longer receiving seucrity updates.**
